Investigate influence of the rated voltage level on size and cost of the
electric motors by working with the system consisting of a motor and a frequency
converter. Take PUMP as the application and design the drive systems for the
four sets of pump parameters:

1. _head_ 200 m, _flow_ 85 l/s, _efficiency_ 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm;
1. _head_ 200 m, _flow_ 145 l/s, _efficiency_ 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm;
1. _head_ 200 m, _flow_ 200 l/s, _efficiency_ 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm.

Set motor type to _SCIM_, cooling to _IC411_, efficiency class to _IE3_,
protection to _IP21_. Design the drive system so that machine and converter
voltage is around 400 V, then 690 V, then 3300 V and, finally, 6000 V.

- [!] Make sure you keep machine type, efficiency class, cooling, protection
  class and other parameters except voltage and power the same for all the cases
  above. Include these parameters in your report.

Record power, weight and cost of motors for the three pumps above and for the
four voltages. Present the results as a chart or a table, draw conclusions.

Can you explain the results/conclusions as the electric machines designer, in
terms of winding design (insulation, cooling)?
