## C-1. Design for constrained space

Design drive system for the conveyor situated in a narrow passage. L = 120 cm (see the sketch).

import Image from "next/image";

import C1Image from "./images/C1.png";

<img src={C1Image.src} width="60%" height="60%" /> _Fig.1. Explanation for the task._

Available information:
* One drum to be driven
* No overloads, duty cycle – 100%
* Dusty environment, abundant heat removal capability, wet floor
* Grid 400 V
* Distance between the driven drum of the conveyor and the FC (cable length) – 30 m
* Rated torque 10 kNm
* Speeds: min – 200 rpm, max - 250 rpm
* Cooling water available

Design for:
(A) Design system for lowest cost. (B) Design system for highest efficiency

## C-2.Design for applications with different duties

Design drive system for the three conveyors with different duties (a) duty 100%, (b) 70%, (c) 50%. Duty cycle period – 1 min.

Available information:
* One drum to be driven
* Rated torque 50 kNm
* Speeds: min – 75 rpm, max -150 rpm
* No overloads
* Air-conditioned clean power house, abundant heat removal capability
* Grid 400 V
* Distance of conveyor from FC (cable length) – 40 m
* Cooling water not available

Use helical gearbox with ratio 1:5.

Summarize the data in a table like the one below. Explain the results.


| Case |	Duty | Motor type | FC type | Cost motor | Cost FC | Cost total |
|	-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 |	100%  |  | |  | |  |
| 2 |	70%  |  | |  | |  |
| 3 |	50%  |  | |  | |  | |


## C-3.Design for applications with different overloads

You are chief engineer at a plant. Design drive system for the five conveyors. Design for the following overload variants:
* (a) No overloads (0%),
* (b) 100% 2 sec each 1 min,
* (c) 100% 1 min each 10 min,  
* (d) 100% 2 min each 20 min.
* (e) 50% 1 min each 10 min.

Available information:
* One drum to be driven
* Rated torque 10 kNm
* Speeds: min – 400 rpm, max - 630 rpm
* Duty 100%
* Air-conditioned clear power house, abundant heat removal capability
* Grid 400 V
* Distance pump from FC (cable length) – 40 m
* Cooling water not available

Explain the results.

| Case |	Overload | Motor type | FC type | Cost motor | Cost FC | Cost total |
|	-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 |	No  |  | |  | |  |
| 2 |	100% 2 sec each 1 min  |  | |  | |  |
| 3 |	100% 1 min each 10 min |  | |  | |  |
| 4 |	100% 5 min each 20 min |  | |  | |  |
| 5 |	50% 1 min each 10 min |  | |  | |  | |


## C-4. Design for lowest system cost

Design drive system for the four conveyors with different speeds (the same power).

Given parameters:
* No overloads
* Duty - 100% (uninterruptable operation)
* Location/environment – clean room
* Grid - 690 V
* Cooling water not available
* Speeds and torques according to the table:

| Case |	speed, rpm | torque, kNm |
|	-- | -- | -- |
| 1 |	100...500 | 10 |
| 2 |	300...500 | 10 |
| 3 |	20...100 | 50 |
| 4 |	70...100 | 50 |


Design for: lowest investment cost (CAPEX). Assume energy efficiency is not important. Present total system efficiency at 100% load, 50% load


## C-5. Design for long and short cables

Design drive system for the conveyor with two drums to be driven. Load sharing 50/50%. You are free to choose where the drive and the transformer (if any) will be located. Also free to choose voltage level.

Note: only one possible variant is shown on the sketch in Fig.1.

import C5Image from "./images/C5.png";

<img src={C5Image.src} width="100%" height="100%" /> _Fig.1. Explanation of the task._

Available information:
* Rated torque 60 kNm (for the total conveyor)
* Operational speeds 40 - 200 rpm
* 20% overloads
* Duty cycle – 100%
* Choose between two power houses with 6000 V and 690 V voltage sources
* Power houses: constrained space (try to minimize footprint)

Design the system for lowest cost.
