description: What is DriveConstructor?
---

_DriveConstructor_ is the online educational software. It was created to support
professors teaching design of power conversion systems. It is possible to use
the software for sketching solutions for the real world problems. However, it
was developed first of all for the educational purposes. The software together
with the Textbook and the [Exercize books](/docs/exercises) form the integral
online course in power conversion system design. The knowledge can be acquired
in a structured way through solving the tasks proposed in the
[Exercize books](/docs/exercises).

A task can be for example driving a mechanism, like pump or conveyor, by using
electric power from the grid. Such a task requires conversion of the energy from
electric into mechanical whereby the electric machine, being the "heart" of the
power conversion system, works as a motor. Another example of a task can be
delivering power extracted from the water flow by a tidal turbine into the grid;
here conversion takes place from mechanical energy into electric energy whereby
the electric machine works as a generator.

The system between the mechanism and the grid can include various components;
both electrical, such as frequency converters and transformers, and mechanical,
such as gearboxes. The components, put together into the power conversion
system, can be called a drive train or a drive system (this is, by the way, why
this online software is called _DriveConstructor_)

Providers of the equipment often call the tasks _Applications_.

In _DriveConstructor_ it is possible to design systems for the four
applications: [pumps](/docs/textbook/applications/pumps), conveyor, winch (or
winder) and wind (or tidal) turbine. The applications have different load
profiles and operational modes.

Navigating through the Textbook and solving the tasks one can learn how to
specify the mechanisms and the system components for the proposed applications
and how to design optimal systems.
