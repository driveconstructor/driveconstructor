title: Gearboxes
---

A gearbox uses combinations of cogwheels to provide speed and torque conversions
from a rotating power source to another device. Each gearbox is characterized by
_gear ratio_ which is defined as the input speed relative to the output speed.
Gear ratio can be related to one stage in the gearbox or to the whole gearbox if
the latter consists of more than one stage. Overall gear ratio is a product of
ratios of all stages. Also overall efficiency is a product of efficiencies of
all stages.

In _DriveConstructor_ gearbox can have maximum three stages. However, in the
real world some gearboxes may have more than three stages.

When choosing a gearbox the designer should remember service factors, take
account of the number of starts, impact loading and the like. Typical procedure
of gearbox selection includes the following steps:

1. Choose gear type
2. Choose transmission ratio («gear ratio»)
3. Determine the nominal power rating of the gear unit
4. Check for maximum torque, e.g. peak operating, starting or braking torque
5. Check additional forces
6. Check thermal capacity (derating due to ambient temperature)
7. Check mounting (all parts to be lubricated should be lying in the oil or be
   splash-lubricated)

In _DriveConstructor_ this procedure is present in a simplified version.

## Stage types

Stages may be of different types as is presented below. In one gearbox there can
be combined stages of different types.

##### Helical

Helical stage is presented in Fig.2. Gear ratios for helical gear stage can be
in the range of 1,5...10. In _DriveConstructor_ we narrow the possibility to
choose from to 3...8. Efficiency of helical gear is high - usually between 97
and 98%. In _DriveConstructor_ we assume rated efficiency of 98%. This type of
gear is cheap to manufacture and has good torque and noise properties, though it
is generally expensive and requires many gear stages for large reductions.

##### Worm gear

Worm stage is presented in Fig.3. Gear ratios for worm stage can be from 5 and
up extremely high ratios (100!). In _DriveConstructor_ we narrow the possible to
choose from to 10...40. Efficiency of worm gears goes down with the increase of
the ratio (Fig.4). The possibility to have very high transmission ratios
translates into greater cost-effectiveness. Also, worm gears typically ensure
quiet, vibration-free operation. They are inherently a right-angle drive. Their
typically low efficiency suggests their use for low or middle-to-low power
demand applications and/or those featuring intermittent duty. They can be ideal
for applications that need to resist reversing.

##### Planetary gear

Planetary stage is presented in Fig.5. Gear ratios for planetary stage can be in
the range of 3...10. In _DriveConstructor_ we narrow the possibility to choose
from to 4...8. Planetary gears can handle large reductions and give huge torque
capability. They have high efficiency and are very compact. At the same time
such gears are expensive to manufacture and can be noisy at high speeds.

stage_.

##### Bevel gear

Bevel stage is presented in Fig.6. Gear ratios for bevel stage can be in the
range of 1,5...4. In _DriveConstructor_ we limit the choice to 2...3.

## Combinations of stages

The stages can be put together in various combinations. Some examples are
presented below.

Gearboxes comprising several helical stages (Fig.7) are used generally in
heavy-duty applications. They are quite efficient and can have many stages.

<img src={gear_3_helical_stagesImage.src} width="50%" height="50%" /> _Fig.7.

In the configuration presented in Fig.8 the input and output shafts are arranged
at right angles via a gear set with either intersecting (bevel helical) or
non-intersecting (hypoid) axes. The right-angle helical design ensures great
space efficiency interms of width, and provides the primary alternative to worm
reducers in applications involving right angle drives. They are characterized by
high efficiency and can extend to extremely high reduction ratios (even to
1700:1).

Efficiency of any combination is the product of efficiencies of the stages,
therefore, efficiency of several stages is lower than single-stage solution.
Fig.12 presents efficiencies of some combinations of stages. Note that lower rpm
means higher gear ratio.
