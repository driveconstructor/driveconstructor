## What is included

Only rotating AC machines with cylindrical cores with inner rotor are included
into this version of _DriveConstructor_. It is possible to choose between:

- _SCIM_ - Squirrel Cage Induction Machine (Fig.1),
- _SyRM_ - Synchronous Reluctance Machine (Fig.2),
- _PMSM_ - Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (rotor shown in Fig.3).

of PMSM_.

SCIM, PMSM and SyRM can be selected for any application and any drive train
topology. SyRM are available for quite limited range of powers. So far only LV
SyRM products are known, therefore only LV FC can be used to drive SyRM.

Performances of the machines of different types are different. Usually:

- Efficiency (SCIM) < Efficiency (SyRM) < Efficiency (PMSM)
- Cost (SCIM) < Cost (SyRM) < Cost (PMSM)
- Size (SCIM) > Size (SyRM) > Size (PMSM)

## Key parameters of electric machines

#### Rated power

Power rating of the electric machines available in _DriveConstructor_ is
according to IEC 60072-1 which suggests the following preferred ratings (based
on a subset of the R40 series) for motors (in kW) and generators (in kVA):

import EM_rated_powersImage from "./images/EM_rated_powers.png";

<img src={EM_rated_powersImage.src} width="100%" height="100%" />
[Source:
IEC](http://www.openelectrical.org/wiki/index.php?title=Standard_IEC_Ratings)

Note that asterix-marked powers are "secondary series" ratings and are only to
be used in cases of special need.

In _DriveConstructor_ we use the following series of powers (in kW): 1.1, 1.5,
2.2, 3, 4, 5.5, 7.5, 11, 15, 18.5, 22, 30, 37, 45, 55, 75, 90, 110, 132, 160,
200, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 900, 1000, 1250,
1400, 1600, 2000, 2500, 3150, 4000.

Our list is shorter than the IEC one as we picked up only the most used powers.

#### Rated voltage

Electric machines may be designed for different supply voltages (from converter
or grid). Machines are usually designed for "standard" ranges of rated voltage,
e.g. 380-400 V or 650-700 V, as it is easier to connect a "standard" machine to
a typical grid or a "standard" frequency converter. In Europe and America the
standard ranges are different. In Europe it is usual to differentiate between
_LV_ (below 1 kV) and _MV_ (above 1 kV).

In _DriveConstructor_ the range of rated voltages to which the machine is
designed to operate within can be chosen from the following options: 380-440,
650-700, 3200-3400, 5900-6700, 9000-12000 V. If it is desirable that the voltage
is chosen automatically then choose "any". It is assumed that all machines are
_Y_-connected. In practice windings can be reconnected into _D_, but this option
is not included.

Machines designed for lower voltage are usually smaller, lighter and cheaper
than those designed for MV. This is because of thinner insulation in the slots,
which allows putting more copper in the slots and makes heat removal easier.

It is normally not possible to design LV machines for very high powers as
currents would become too high and cables would become too thick to be
practical. LV machines are normally produced for powers from fractions of kW up
to a few MW (in _DriveConstructor_ up to 2 MW), MV machines - from about 0,2 MW
to 10...20 MW (in _DriveConstructor_ up to 5 MW), in some cases up to 100 MW!

Slot designs of LV and MV machines look quite different:

import LV_slotImage from "./images/LV_slot.png";

<img src={LV_slotImage.src} width="30%" height="30%" /> _Fig.4. LV slot._

import HV_slotImage from "./images/HV_slot.png";

<img src={HV_slotImage.src} width="50%" height="50%" /> _Fig.5. HV slot._

#### Rated synchronous speed

Rated synchronous speed is proportional to supply frequency and reverse
proportional to number of poles ($$n=120*f/p$$). For 50 Hz supply and number of
poles 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 rated synchronous speed is 3000, 1500, 1000, 750 and
600, respectively.

SCIM have slip, so its rated speed is lower than rated synchronous speed by a
few percent. SyRM and PMSM have rated speed equal rated synchronous speed.

It is obvious that a machine designed for delivering high power is bigger than a
machine designed for delivering low power. It is less obvious that the rated
speed the machine is designed for affects it's weight, compactness, rotor
inertia and cost. However, if the power is fixed, the machine with lower speed
will have higher torque ($$T\sim P/n$$). To be able to provide higher torque the
machine has to be larger, heavier and as the consequence more expensive.

## Efficiency class

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed an
internationally applicable testing Standard IEC 60034-2-1 for electric motors
and a classification scheme IEC 60034-30-1 with four levels of motor efficiency
("IE-code"):

- IE1 Standard efficiency,
- IE2 High efficiency,
- IE3 Premium efficiency
- IE4 Super premium efficiency.

The IE-code and its efficiency levels create a basic vocabulary for governments
to determine the efficiency level for their minimum energy performance standards
(MEPS). The European Union sets motor MEPS levels (Directive 640/2009) at IE3
(or IE2 in combination with a variable frequency drive) from 2015 for smaller
motors and from 2017 covering also larger motors.

_Fig.6. Cut-away of standard, energy-efficient, and premium efficiency motors._

Efficiency value for a certain class depends on power as shown on the diagram
below:

import Efficiency_class3Image from "./images/Efficiency_class3.png";

<img src={Efficiency_class3Image.src} width="70%" height="70%" />

_Fig.7. Efficiency classes for 4-pole motors._

Efficiency at partial load (e.g. 25%, 50%) is lower than at rated load (100%).
High efficiency class motors are larger and heavier, while lower IE class motors
are more compact and lighter. Therefore, motors with higher IE class are more
expensive.

## Cooling

Cooling arrangements are usually chosen to minimize machine cost. Other factors,
such as the availability of cooling water, the need to minimize airborne noise,
or space limitations, may influence the eventual choice. There exist many types
(classes) of cooling. However, in _DriveConstructor_ the choice is limited to
the three classes presented below:

- air-cooled self-cooled, designated _IC411_
- air-cooled forced-cooled _IC416_ (forced ventilation independent from the
  shaft)
- water-cooled _IC71W_

import Cooling1Image from "./images/Cooling1.png";

<img src={Cooling1Image.src} width="40%" height="40%" /> _Fig.8. IC411_.

import Cooling2Image from "./images/Cooling2.png";

<img src={Cooling2Image.src} width="48%" height="48%" /> _Fig.9. IC416. Note
separate motor for driving the fan_.

import Cooling3Image from "./images/Cooling3.png";

<img src={Cooling3Image.src} width="40%" height="40%" /> _Fig.10. IC71W. Note
the cooling mantle_.

Fig. 11 shows that _IC416_ provides more load capacity at low speeds than
_IC411_. It is because the independently fed fan motor of _IC416_ configuration
allows maintaining the cooling air flow independently on the rotor speed.

<img src={cooling_411_vs_416Image.src} width="60%" height="60%" /> _Fig.11.
IC411 vs IC416_.

Water-cooled machines can be 20-40% smaller than air-cooled IP54/55 machines. If
cooling water is available, some economies in motor size can be obtained by the
use of water-cooling.

## Mechanical design

#### Mounting variants

There are three basic variants of mounting included in _DriveConstructor_: B3 -
foot-mounted, B5 - flange-mounted, B35 - machine with both feet and flange. The
difference between mounting variants is reflected in price. Flange-mounted
machine would have 1-3% higher price and flange&foot-mounted - by 5%, compared
to the basic foot-mounted design.

import EM_mounting1Image from "./images/EM_mounting1.png";

<img src={EM_mounting1Image.src} width="20%" height="20%" /> _Fig.12. B3_

import EM_mountingB5Image from "./images/EM_mountingB5.png";

<img src={EM_mountingB5Image.src} width="20%" height="20%" /> _Fig.13. B5_

import EM_mountingB35Image from "./images/EM_mountingB35.png";

<img src={EM_mountingB35Image.src} width="20%" height="20%" /> _Fig.14. B35_

#### Shaft height

IEC and NEMA has standardized motor dimensions, including shaft height.

import Shaft_heightImage from "./images/Shaft_height.png";

<img src={Shaft_heightImage.src} width="40%" height="40%" /> _Fig.15. Shaft
height illustration._

Standard shaft heights row in mm: 56, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 132, 160, 180,
200, 225, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710. If the shaft height
of the driven mechanism is set, then it can be beneficial to choose electric
machine with the same or close shaft height to simplify coupling of the motor
and the mechanism. If the shaft height of the driven mechanism is unknown then
for the electric machine "any" can be chosen instead of some concrete value.
Shaft height is approximately equal to half the diameter (_h=OD/2_).

#### Frame material

The available frame materials are used based on their mechanical strength,
density, heat transfer capability, cost, corrosion resistance, etc. In
_DriveConstructor_ it is possible to choose from Aluminum (AL), Cast Iron (CI)
and Steel (S). Some characteristics of the materials in comparison to the others
are given below:

- Aluminum
- vs CI&S: Aluminum is almost two-three times lighter than steel or cast iron
  but several times more expensive
- vs CI&S: Aluminum is a better heat conductor than steel or cast iron. The
  extrusion process enhances aluminum's heat conducting properties by allowing
  the frame sections to have thinner fins placed closer together. The result is
  more fins and greater surface area for maximum cooling. So, machines with
  aluminum frames will be more compact and lighter
- vs CI&S: Machines with aluminum frames are usually cheaper and easier to
  install (because they are lighter).

- Cast iron
- vs AL: Cast iron machines don't have corrosion problems. Their frames are much
  stronger than aluminum frames, but they are heavier and harder to install.
- vs S: Cast iron is cheaper than steel

- Steel
- vs CI: The yield strength of steel is higher than the ultimate strength of
  cast iron. This makes steel much stronger and 250% more rigid than cast iron.
  Cast iron is perceived as a rugged motor frame material because of its
  bulkiness, when in reality its relatively fragile nature requires 2-1/2 times
  as much metal to approach the performance of steel. And when it comes to
  impact loads, steel provides much greater resistance to cracking.

Aluminum frames are usually used up to 60 kW, steel and cast iron frames - to MW
level.

## Insulation classes

Anyone specifying or using electric machines should have understanding of how
the insulation is related to temperature. Three classes of insulation are in
common use (with _F_ being the most common):

- class _B_ - with a maximum operating temperature of $$130^\circ C$$
- class _F_ - with a maximum operating temperature of $$155^\circ C$$
- class _H_ - with a maximum operating temperature of $$180^\circ C$$

Typically motors are designed for a maximum ambient temperature of 40
$$^\circ C$$. The difference between the average winding temperature and any hot
spot is limited and it is usual to allow a 10 $$^\circ C$$ margin for class _B_
and _F_ insulation and a 15 $$^\circ C$$ margin for class _H_.

| Insulation class               | B               | F               | H               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Maximum insulation temperature | $$130^\circ C$$ | $$155^\circ C$$ | $$180^\circ C$$ |
| Maximum temperature rise       | $$80^\circ C$$  | $$100^\circ C$$ | $$125^\circ C$$ |

Note that electrical machines are designed for an overall temperature rise to a
level that is below the maximum specified for the insulation materials. For
example, using class-F insulation:

max ambient + max temperature rise = $$40^\circ C + 100^\circ C = 140^\circ C$$,

which gives a thermal researve of $$15^\circ C$$. The larger the thermal
researve, the longer the life expectancy of the insulation material.

When operating conteniously at the maximum rated temperaure of its class, the
life expectancy of the insulation is about 10 years. Most machines do not
operate at such extreme conditions because an additional safety margin is
usually allowed between the calculated load torque requirements and the actual
size of the machine chosen for the application. So life expectancy of a machine,
which is correctly matched to its load and with suitable safety margins, can
reasonably be taken between 15 and 25 years. It is common practice to design
machines for class-_B_ temperature rise but to actually use class-_F_ insulation
materials. This provides an extra $$20^\circ C$$ thermal that will extend the
life expectancy to more than 20 years. This also means that the machine could be
used at higher ambient temperatures of up to $$50^\circ C$$ or more,
theoretically up to $$65^\circ C$$.

Running motors at a reduced temperature will also significantly extend the
useful life. For example, a machine operating at $$180^\circ C$$ will have an
estimated life of

- only 300 hours with Class _A_ insulation
- only 1800 hours with Class _B_ insulation
- only 8500 hours with Class _F_ insulation
- tens of thousands of hours with Class _H_ insulation
