title: Pump types and load curves

Pumps can be classified by their method of the fluid displacement. There are
many classifications, one of them is presented in Fig. 1.

_Fig.1. Pump classification._

There are two basic types of pumps: positive displacement and centrifugal
(rotodynamic). Load curves (torque-speed characteristics) of these two types of
pumps are different:

    - Centrifugal pumps have quadratic load curve (QT) $$T \sim n^2$$ (Fig.2)
    - Positive displacement pumps have constant load (CT) curve $$T \sim const$$ (Fig.3)

Quadratic loads are often approximately represented by assuming that the torque
required is proportional to the square of the speed, giving rise to the terms
square-law load.
