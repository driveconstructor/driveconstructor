## Head and flow

Rated head and flow are the key characteristic of any pump and is always specified by the pump manufacturer.

The static Head (H) of a pump is the maximum pressure it can deliver (height to which the pump lifts the liquid). In DriveConstructor this parameter is entered in m.

Flow (Q), also referred to as volume flow rate or capacity, is the volume of liquid that travels through the pump in a given time (measured in liter per second of cubic meter per hour). Rated flow is the key characteristic of any pump and is always specified by the pump manufacturer. In DriveConstructor this parameter is entered in $$m^3/h$$
or $$l/s$$.
