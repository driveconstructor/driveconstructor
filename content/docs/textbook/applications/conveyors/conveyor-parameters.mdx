title: Parameters of conveyors
---

In *DriveConstructor* we operate with the type of curves shown in Fig.1. We assume torque is constant in the given speed range. Short-term overload can be specified. Also very short-term overloads for starting the conveyor (breakaway torque) can be specified.

import Image from "next/image";
import concurImage from "./images/conveyor-curves.png";

<img src={concurImage.src} alt="conveyor-curves" width="40%" height="40%" />
*Fig.1.*

So, one needs to specify:

   - minimum and maximum rotational speed of the conveyor drum,
   - rated torque,
   - overload torque,
   - starting (breakaway) torque, and
   - conveyor duty
