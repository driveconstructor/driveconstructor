title: Conveyors
---

Conveyors are used in various industries: metallurgical, petrochemical, mining,
glass, brewing, textile, food, printing, furniture, machinery, coal, as well as
many others. In a conveyor one or more drums (rollers) can be driven by
motor(s). Fig. 1-2 below show designs with one motor per drum. Mutual position
of the axle of the driven drum and the motor shaft are defined by the gearbox
type. There can be an angle between the axles if bevel gear stage or worm gear
stage is used.

### Benefits of VSD for conveyors

Equipping conveyor with variable speed drive (VSD) (motor and frequency
converter) provides a number of advantages:

_a) Improving the process controllability_

The automatic control system of the frequency converter can maintain constant
load or constant speed regardless of the load. Conveyor's control system may be
integrated in the automation system of higher level.

_b) Energy savings_

Load of some conveyors, such as e.g. the belt conveyor at coal mines and
ore-processing enterprises are quite difficult to predict because of the varying
demand of the transportation. Idling or modes close to it can reach 20-40% of
the operating time of the conveyor. The use of VSD provides smooth control of
the belt speed, maximizes energy savings under variable loads, regardless of the
profile of transport distribution.

_c) High starting torque_

The frequency converter provides high starting torque (up to 200% of the nominal
value). In the event of an emergency stop it is not necessary to unload the
conveyor because a high starting torque gives the possibility to even start a
fully loaded conveyor.

_g) Less wear of the mechanical parts and switching equipment at start_

Stepless speed increase when starting the conveyor protects the mechanical parts
from wear and prolongs service life. Soft-start is also favorable for the power
switching equipment and the mains.

_d) Increased line speed_

Using a frequency converter allows the conveyor to operate at speeds above par,
if required by the process.

_e) Load balancing on motors, shaft synchronization_

If the conveyor is provided with two or more motors, there is a need for load
balancing between the engines and the synchronization of their shafts. Modern
frequency converters have a software that allows you to implement these
functions.

## Parameters of conveyors

In _DriveConstructor_ we operate with the type of curves shown in Fig.1. We
assume torque is constant in the given speed range. Short-term overload can be
specified. Also very short-term overloads for starting the conveyor (breakaway
torque) can be specified.

*Fig.1.*

So, one needs to specify:

- minimum and maximum rotational speed of the conveyor drum,
- rated torque,
- overload torque,
- starting (breakaway) torque, and
- conveyor duty
